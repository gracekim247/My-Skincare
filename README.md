# My-Skincare
I am obsessed with skincare. Lately I've gotten into global products, especially ones from East-Asia. They're my holy-grail!!! Over the past few years of my skincare obsession, I've developed an extensive routine and product knowledge that I thought wouldn't hurt to share. So I've created a webpage about my current skincare products, AM and PM routine, and wishlist! Hope you enjoy!
